# Acknowledgements

Wille is inspired by many great libraries, frameworks, and philosophies, which are presented on this page.

## Next.js & Vercel

I love Next.js. I have created and operated over twenty Next.js projects on Vercel. At Wille, I have adopted the file system-based router concept of Next.js.

## tRPC

tRPC is one of the libraries that has allowed me to improve my development efficiency the most over the past few years. At Wille, I have used it as a reference for how to make page handlers type-safe.

## Fresh

Fresh is a full-stack web framework. Fresh and Wille are probably similar in what they are trying to achieve, and Fresh is better done. 

I'm considering that if Fresh could run on Cloudflare, Wille would likely be unnecessary.
